# Monokai Light Theme

A version of the monokai light theme for Atom. The monokai light them was created for those of us who prefer, for whatever reason, themes with lighter backgrounds. This is a port of the [https://github.com/rjfranco/monokai-light](textmate version) that I had started in ages long past, and I plan to continue to support both, but figured they should be seperate repos so I could add this one to the atom repository.

Contributions and suggestions are very welcome.
